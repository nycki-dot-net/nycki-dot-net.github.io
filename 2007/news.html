<font color="red"><i>08/01/2007:</i></font> I guess what's new today is that I ummm, have a news page? I had an idea for the logo in the middle of the night last night and I got out of bed, drew the compass thingy, inked it, and went back to bed. This morning I colored it in photoshop and added it to my website, along with this news page. If I ever update again, You'll know about it here.
