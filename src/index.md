## welcome!

my name is Nycki ([ˈnɪki](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=%CB%88n%C9%AAki)), and [this is a website!](http://hrwiki.org/wiki/First_Time_Here%3F)

## capitalization?

yep, I'm doing the 'intentionally lowercase' thing. I like to reserve capital letters for names. more thoughts on this in my [cookbook](https://klay.gay/self-host).

## contact

some of these will change as I transition from my old internet name 'nupa' to my new one 'nycki'. it's just personal preference, I'll still answer to either name for the time being. oh yeah my pronouns are she/they now, thanks!

## creations

stuff I've made!

### braceless javascript
2018\. a couple of short programs written in browser JavaScript, with the special restriction that I can't use any instructions that require curly braces, like 'if' or 'for'. instead, I replace these instructions with ternaries and lambdas, which makes this a functional programming exercise!
